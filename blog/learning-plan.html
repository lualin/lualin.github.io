                <h3>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I have decided to make my career pathway more deep into developer environment since last year when I
                    made
                    decision to be a software developer. <br>
                    This is not limited to front-end but it also includes back-end area to be competent in both areas
                    that will turn
                    me into full-stack developer. <br>
                </p>
                <span><br></span>
                <hr>
                <h3>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
                </h3>
                <p>
                    One of my strength is to dive deeply into a topic when I start learning about it to clear understand
                    what it is.
                    <br>
                    Then limitations will incur in learning due to my lack of knowledge but I will try to overcome the
                    limitations
                    by keeping good habits of continuous research. <br>
                </p>
                <span><br></span>
                <hr>
                <h3>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while
                    at Dev
                    Academy?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I would like to learn more about how to set my ways of thinking and mind like a developer as well as
                    the
                    communication skills.
                </p>
                <span><br></span>
                <hr>
                <h3>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
                </h3>
                <span><br></span>

                <h3>a) An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other
                    learners,
                    Facilitators and industry/community representatives
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Through continuous communication with others and sticking to timeline of each task to work
                    productively.
                    Always be respectful to others for better performance.
                </p>
                <span><br></span>

                <h3>b) What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
                </h3>
                <p>
                    When things will start to building up, I will firstly organise the things I have done previously in
                    fairly
                    appropriate way so the new things can get in easily.
                </p>
                <span><br></span>
                <hr>
                <h3>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
                <p>
                    There are loads of resources online to seek for help when I am in learning blocks, or I can ask for
                    help with
                    collegues and facilitators as well.
                </p>

                </h3>
                <p>
                    I will need a lot of help from them throughout this course while I am learning new things and I
                    believe that
                    they would be able to guide me to right direction :)
                </p>
                <span><br></span>
                <hr>
                <h3>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. <br>
                    For example, you
                    might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Not applicable for me, I am entirely committed to this course only in my current situation as my
                    family is in
                    overseas.

                <h2>Learning Plan - Part 2</h2>

                <h3> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I truly believe that amount of skills with useful resources will be learnt during this course
                    especially in bootcamp by doing more practical exercises.
                    Still trying to find my pathway during this course however I personally am wishing to be a
                    full-stack developer involved in front-end, back-end and server to make myself more competitive.
                    I understand that there is far more way to go to achieve this goal as there are too many things to
                    learn within this IT industry.
                    In this fast evolving environment, continuous and constant learning habits are important to place
                    myself at higher capacity.
                    I will probably be focused on seeking for job after this course surely but I am highly prepared to
                    increase my own value by having constantly learning habits even I successfully complete this course.
                    When looking at the trends going on recently such as artificial Intelligence, the techonology is
                    flowing so rapidly more than I expected and it actually stimulates me to do more studying.

                <h3> What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I still think that these will still go on in the bootcamp as well. The limitations of getting stuck
                    at somewhere during the learning will happen anytime that might stop me to think about the problems.
                    However having a positive mindset to overcome these limitations would be compulsory throughout the
                    bootcamp. Especially in coding, things are not always working as what I expect as I have experience
                    during foundations when doing some excercises.
                    Whenever I got stuck at stuck at some points while doing coding assignments, I had to spend hours to
                    find problems and research for solutions to fix the bugs.
                    It was quite worth the time spent as I could learn lessons from this experience and my
                    problem-solving skills will also improve accordingly.
                    From the accummulated experiences, I should be able to spend less time to solve the problems and
                    find more optimised ways for the solutions.

                <h3> What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I personally think that I am not really kind of well-speaking person so it might be a little
                    challenge for me when I will be faced at something like presentation or similar.
                    However I should deal with this as well to overcome as I acknowledge that I will be involved in this
                    kind of situation many times in the future when I get out to reality.

                <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev
                    Academy?</h3>
                <p>
                    It will probably be the communication skills to improve for myself. This is honestly the main factor
                    of good teamwork especially in group based environment.
                    Developers usually work together to create a work so improving communication skills is highly
                    important for optimal results within a team. <br>

                    I also think that I have lack of leadership skills in this context. Being a good leader in a team
                    quite attracts me as a good leader is a person who can lead a team towards the goal, clarifying the
                    goal of team, drawing out solidified motivation and directing a team towards the future vision.
                    I hope that I might reach that level of leadership by improving it during this course and throughout
                    my journey after it.

                <p>
                    For both technical and non-technical (human skills, mindset) areas, I would like a support from them
                    to guide me to right pathway to be a nice personal entity and good developer.
                    I have learnt a lot from the core task during the foundation how it is important to have mentally
                    healthy mindset which is not limited to this industry only but it also helps all people to have good
                    personality.
