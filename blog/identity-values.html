        <h2>Identity and Values</h2>
      <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. <br> Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in
        that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h3>
      <p>
        There was a situation when I have found an unknown purse in a shopping centre near toilet.
        Even though no people were around seeing me, I just passed it to the information desk without any hesitation.
        I always have believed that the money gotten from this kind of way will not make anything better.
        Human instinct for getting this purse into pocket could work, but my ethical decision was higher than that.
        This could cause illegally huge problems as I thought that it might be considered as theft or something. 
        When it comes to my reflection on that situation, I would definitely do the same thing whenever it happens
        again. <br>

      <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I always tend to get along with kind and humble people as they certainly influence my values and identity in
        positive way. <br>
        By helping and suppoting each other, the true friendship and relationship will increand and it can lead to
        having better values and identity. <br>

      <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I could say that one of my strengths related to people is being humble and respectful to others. <br>
        Surely I could help my people when they need my help as I believe that it will get paid when I need help from
        them later. <br>
        And by showing much respect to others as much as I can, I can get their respect as well to build strongly
        positive culture around me. <br>
        This will really helpful for my learning journey and even life journey. <br>
      </p>

      <h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. <br> How might these affect your
        learning journey?
      </h3>
      <p>
        There is high possibility for me to have limitations when I keep learning for development industry then I will
        find many obstacles on the way. <br>
        These obstacles will stop me while learning however overcoming these is essential to be able to stay in this
        industry. <br>
        I know that this is not limited to this career only but this always happens anywhere. <br>
        Being humble in my position and attempting to jump over my limitations will later make better me. <br>
      </p>

      <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or
        tension. <br>
        Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies
        you would try now and why.
      </h3>
      <p>
        When I was working in logistics company last year, there were some cases to work together as a team. <br>
        There always have been conflicts when sharing their opinion at the first stage, however trying to understand all
        of these opinions and working out for best solution through conversation were helped. <br>
        I know that working together in a team is very usual in development area and I should acknowledge ways to
        cooperate well together for good results. <br>
        Personally thinking that good communication and working with methodologies for strict time management will
        really help which is more productive and being timely-manner. <br>
