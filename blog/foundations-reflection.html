                </h3>
                <p>
                    1. <b>Neuroplasticity</b> - Maintaining our brains in optimal condition via various ways such as
                    meditaion and positive thinking and vigorously activating our brain changes by passionately engaging
                    in new learning environment.
                    Then our brain cells will continuously grow and reorganise by these external stimulation. <br>
                    2. <b>Growth Mindset</b> - Having a growth mindset to keep developing myself for better performance
                    and to embrace challenges that can incur at anytime, at any kind of forms. Being not afraid to fall
                    by those challeges by actively confronting them to find solutions. <br>
                    3. <b>Problems Solving Skills</b> - Ways on how to approach the problems everytime I get confronted.
                    What kind of measurements I will take to solve them. And in what kind of mindset I should be in to
                    embrace these problems.

                <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Values: </b>Learners and programmers both need to have clear set of values kept in mind in order
                    to make responsible and ethical decisions when they are commited to learning and programming so what
                    has to be done can be prioritise based on this set of values.
                    In the context of programming, a developer who has ethical ways of thinking, can create a software
                    at the high standards of ethics which would be more valuable. <br>
                    <b>Empathy: </b>A developer with having good empathy can create a software that is more
                    user-friendly and accessible by passionately accommodating users' feedback from diverse backgrounds.
                    <br>
                    <b>Self-Awareness: </b>A developer with having good self-awareness can identity what areas need to
                    be improved and what steps to be taken to address them. Being self-aware is important to acknowledge
                    limitations and have willing to improve abilities. <br>

                <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
                <p>
                    What surprised me the most about learning core is to deeply reflect on myself as to find out several
                    factors of internal and emotional side of me.
                    It was good opportunity to look back myself and think about how I can develop and improve my
                    identity and values through numerous ways.
                    Things like neuroplasticity to stimulate my brain cells to grow up by having good learning habits,
                    constructing growth mindset to be motivative and flexible for learning new things.
                    This core part of foundations helps guiding me to the right direction of being a better personal
                    entity.
                    I think that this kind of lessons is very beneficial for all people, not limited to people in IT
                    industry, and has good purpose to escalate the level of internal part of people to higher standards.
                    When it comes to this area of being a developer, the core course motivated me how dedication and
                    hard work will take me to greater achievement.

                <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
                <p>
                    The challenging part of the core learning was to understand the terminologies that I did not know. I
                    have been acknowledged that this kind of concept exists somewhere but did not know what they are
                    actually called in reality.
                    It might be more challenging to absorb positive parts of this core learning to me but I hope that I
                    can develop them one by one as time passes by. However it would be more important to have high
                    willingness to actively accommodate them.
                </p>

                <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning
                    in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
                <p>
                    I honestly could not understand why the core learning takes mostly half of the foundation course at
                    the first time, but I came to know by now that it was really beneficial to learn this core course as
                    it has considerably impacted me so much.
                    By learning a couple of main core lessons each sprint, researching about them and writing blogs
                    about the reflection on them were good ways to truly reflect myself.

                <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have
                    just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
                <p>
                    Not at all, I would say that it was worth the time spent to learn the core learning as per what I
                    have mentioned in previous question :)
